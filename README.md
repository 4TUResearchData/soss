# Scientific open source Software (SOSS)

[![Project Status: Active: The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

A repository that given an software arfefact DOI, it will computationally reproduce the software environment of the package.

## Description

This project aims to: (1) extract and link scientific software metadata from package files in a RDF KG and (2) recreate the software artefacts to compare with FAIR Maturity Evaluation services.



## Planning

- Add descriptors on existing RDF data model (reusing existing ontologies)
- Annotate the software deposits in the 4TUResearchData
- converting data to RDF and 
- Use either Shape validators or SPARQL queries
- Integrate into FAIR evaluator
